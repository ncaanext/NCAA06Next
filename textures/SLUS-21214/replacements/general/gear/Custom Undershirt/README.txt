These replace the Rubber Pad elbow equipment and give your player a short sleeve undershirt. Note that some jersey textures already have a small undershirt sleeve. This texture extends below that, and it will look best if the two match in color.

To use, find your team's short undershirt sleeve in alternate_replacements-->gear-->Undershirt Short Sleeves (or create your own), and copy to this folder.

The file should be named exactly as listed below in the "known names" list. If necessary, duplciate the file to ensure there is a copy for each of the names listed below. The files should be indentical, just named differently.

You can make these any color or design you like, but keep in mind that they will appear on any player on any team that has Rubber Pad elbow equipment. No players in the default mod roster have this equipment, and the CPU will never give incoming recruits this or assign it to CPU teams in your dynasty, so it is generally safe to use.
