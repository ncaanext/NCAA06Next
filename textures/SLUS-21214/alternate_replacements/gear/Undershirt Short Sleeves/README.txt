These replace the Rubber Pad elbow equipment and give your player a short sleeve undershirt. Note that some jersey textures already have a small undershirt sleeve. This texture extends below that, and it will look best if the two match in color.

To use one, copy to replacements->general->gear->Custom Undershirt. 

You may only one use one team at a time. You can make these any color or design you like, but keep in mind that they will appear on any player on any team that has Rubber Pad elbow equipment. No players in the default mod roster have this equipment, and no incoming recruits in your dynasty will ever have this equipment either, so it is generally safe to use.
