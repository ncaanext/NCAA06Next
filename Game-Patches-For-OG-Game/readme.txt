This is a collection of separate patches that can possibly be combined to change different aspects of the base game disc.

You can combine and install these patches at the same time as long as they are compatible. As such, you can, and should, create separate iso files for each mod version you want! :)

REMOVED 2021 Rosters patch -- If you want 2021, please transition to our Modern 2021 Game Mod.

Pre-Configured Combos:

1-General-Combo-Patch: This pack combines the Heisman, Text Patch and Uniform patch into a single folder so you can quickly make an ISO for general usage. This allows you to start new dynasties and other features without errors.

Game Patch:
This patch includes updates to the number and helmet number/letter design locations that can not be updated by textures only. This updates the locations for the modern uniforms. This also updates Names database for new recruits, Conference to State alignment data, and Recruit Attributes for Player Model sizing. This should be compatible with all other patches.

This patch updates NCAA Football 06 to NCAA Football NEXT in the pre-game screen. the Pontiac Drive Summary text to say All-State Drive Recap to go with the All-State sponsorship update. They are the official sponsor of NCAA Field Goals. This patch will work with all combinations of patches.

General Instructions
These are general, generic instructions. Each patch has its own set of files that are based on these same instructions here.




Tools Required:
To start, you will need to download an Disc Burning tool. I prefer this free software called ImgBurn.

https://www.imgburn.com/index.php?act=download




Instructions:

Find your NCAA 06 ISO file and double click it in Windows. This will create a new virtual drive.

Create a new folder anywhere on your computer, and call it "NCAA06" or whatever you like.

Open the new Virtual Disc drive. Copy the entire contents into the NCAA06 folder created in Step 2.

Take the PATCH file(s) in this folder, and replace the same file in "NCAA06" folder you created earlier. (PATCH files will vary depending on patch used)

Now open ImgBurn.

Click CREATE IMAGE FROM FILES/FOLDERS on the middle-right side. 

On the left hand side, click the folder search icon ("Browse for a Folder") and select the NCAA06 root folder.

Click the Create ISO icon at the bottom left. Its the icon that looks like a folder pointing to a CD image.

Click through the prompts, choose a name for the ISO, and wait for the app to create a new ISO file.

Now you can start PCSX2 with the new ISO created!
