Broadcast All-State Field Goal/Extra Point on-screen text fix

This patch updates the Pontiac Drive Summary text to say All-State Drive Recap to go with the All-State sponsorship update. They are the official sponsor of NCAA Field Goals. 

This patch works like others and can be combined with any other patch available today.

SLUS_212.14 contains the fix to change the Pontiac branding to All-State. It will need to be added to the Disc/ISO and replace the existing file on the root folder.


Tools Required:
To start, you will need to download an Disc Burning tool. I prefer this free software called ImgBurn.

Instructions:

1. Find your NCAA 06 ISO file and double click it in Windows. This will create a new virtual drive.

2. Create a new folder anywhere on your computer, and call it "NCAA06" or whatever you like.

3. Open the new Virtual Disc drive. Copy the entire contents into the NCAA06 folder created in Step 2.

4. Take the SLUS_212.14 file in this folder, and replace the file in "NCAA06".

5. Now open ImgBurn.

6. Click CREATE IMAGE FROM FILES/FOLDERS on the middle-right side.

7. On the left hand side, click the folder search icon ("Browse for a Folder") and select the NCAA06 root folder.

8. Click the Create ISO icon at the bottom left. Its the icon that looks like a folder pointing to a CD image.

9. Click through the prompts, choose a name for the ISO, and wait for the app to create a new ISO file.

10. Now you can start PCSX2 with the new ISO created!

Hooray!
