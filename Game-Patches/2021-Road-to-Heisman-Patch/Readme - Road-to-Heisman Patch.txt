2021 Rosters Patch for Road to Heisman ISO/Disc

This method creates a modified NCAA 06 Football ISO file that has 2021 base rosters that enables proper Road to Heisman mode. This will also make 2021 rosters default.

You can patch this ISO at the same time as other patches. The Dynasty Mod already includes this patch in it!


Tools Required:
To start, you will need to download an Disc Burning tool. I prefer this free software called ImgBurn.

Instructions:

1. Find your NCAA 06 ISO file and double click it in Windows. This will create a new virtual drive.

2. Create a new folder anywhere on your computer, and call it "NCAA06" or whatever you like.

3. Open the new Virtual Disc drive. Copy the entire contents into the NCAA06 folder created in Step 2.

4. Take the TEMPLATE.DAT file in this folder, and replace the file in "NCAA06" located in its DATA folder.

5. Now open ImgBurn.

6. Click CREATE IMAGE FROM FILES/FOLDERS on the middle-right side.

7. On the left hand side, click the folder search icon ("Browse for a Folder") and select the NCAA06 root folder.

8. Click the Create ISO icon at the bottom left. Its the icon that looks like a folder pointing to a CD image.

9. Click through the prompts, choose a name for the ISO, and wait for the app to create a new ISO file.

10. Now you can start PCSX2 with the new ISO created!


Hooray!
