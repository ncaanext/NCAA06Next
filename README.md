## Known Bugs:

Since this is a beta and we've only done limited testing, bugs may occur! Please let us know when you get them!

There is one known bug, which seems to be a memory related issue, and for majority of users, this will never be a problem. If you simulate a string of weeks or a full season, PLEASE exit the schedule page, and to the main Dynasty menu, before you simulate more games! If you do not, it may cause an error to occur and the entire emulator will need to be rebooted and all progress lost.

This seems to be possibly due to overload of memory/resources, but we are still troubleshooting the root cause. In the mean time, just read the news and standings every time you simulate, and you should be fine.

Make memory card saves and save states often. :)

### Roster updates:

For rosters, you may get a .ps2 memory card file for pcsx2 courtesy of operation sports here:

Memory Card Includes:
1. 2021 Season Div 1A Rosters 
2. 2021 Season Div 1AA Rosters for FBS Schools only (Appalachian State, Texas State, UMass, and Western Kentucky). The rest are auto-named default rosters.
3. Historical Teams Rosters

FBS Rosters were created using <a href=https://github.com/antdroidx/NCAA-Football-PS3-to-PS2-Roster-Porting-Tool>Antdroid's Roster Porting Tool</a> from the Operation Sports NCAA 14 PS3 team's base roster with permission.
